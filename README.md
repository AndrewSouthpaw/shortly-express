# Shortly-Express

This project represents work done solo over a two-day sprint while at Hack Reactor, plus some extra time spent in evenings after that period. All of the work after v0.1 represents extra curricular work.

While my project did come with starter code and scaffolding, I have touched or modified or completely revamped almost everything. Looking at the [initial commit](https://github.com/AndrewSouthpaw/shortly-express/commit/260b74bd4716b09d9a579f9089bfba40e35f651b) will give an idea of what code was available at the start.
